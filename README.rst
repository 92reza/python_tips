Please clone or fork, the notebooks are meant to be interacted with.

If the page won't load copy the link to the .ipynb and drop it `here <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/>`_ to view.

Note that these were written in Python 3 (3.6)

These files are .ipynb. It is a notebook document used by Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment designed to help scientists work with the Python language (as well as Julia and R).

I suggest downloading `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Jupyter Notebook is included in Anaconda.

I've included an inline `python tutor <http://www.pythontutor.com/>`_. Just uncomment it and run the cell to use.

Please feel free to contribute, critique and comment.
