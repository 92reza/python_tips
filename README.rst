Python Tips
===========

Please clone or fork, the notebooks are meant to be interacted with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

These files are .ipynb. It is a notebook document used by Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment designed to help scientists work with the Python language.

I suggest downloading `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_.
Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Jupyter Notebook is included in Anaconda.

I will most likey seperate out functools, iterools and collection into their own .ipynb files. Let me know how I should organize these.

Tips 1 topics:
 - Lambda functions
 - Enumerate
 - List, set and dict comprehension
 - Map
 - Filter 
 - Zip
 - Print formatting
 - Args and kwargs 
 - Mutable parameters

Tips 2 topics (WIP):
 - Itertools (built-in library)
 - Functools (built-in library) reduce, partial.. etc.
 - Collections (built-in library)
 - Decorators
 - Class Inheritance.
 - Generators
 - Datetime (built-in library)
